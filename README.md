# responsive-image-focus
Demo: http://www.jedeveloper.cl/demo2/

When a responsive image shrinks you can lose focus on the most important part of the picture. RIF allows you to choose the area of interest of the image to zoom in on it as the image shrinks. This will always keep attention on the most important area of the image.
